The concept of "virtual packages", which many other packages may provide,
using the Provides mechanism. An example of this is the "httpd" virtual
package, which all web servers should provide. Virtual package names may be
used in dependency headers. However, current policy is that virtual packages
do not support version numbers, so dependencies on virtual packages with
versions will always fail.

Several other control fields, such as Package, Version, Description, Section,
Priority, etc., which are mainly for classification purposes. The package
name must consist entirely of lowercase characters, plus the characters '+',
'-', and '.'. Fields can extend across multiple lines - on the second and
subsequent lines, there is a space at the beginning instead of a field name
and a ':'. Empty lines must consist of the text " .", which will be ignored,
as will the initial space for other continuation lines. This feature is
usually only used in the Description field.

            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
The "dpkg status area" is the term used to refer to the directory where dpkg
keeps its various status files (GNU would have you call it the dpkg shared
state directory). This is always, on Debian systems, /var/lib/dpkg. However,
the default directory name should not be hard-coded, but #define'd, so that
alteration is possible (it is available via configure in dpkg 1.4.0.9 and
above). Of course, in a library, code should be allowed to override the
default directory, but the default should be part of the library (so that
the user may change the dpkg admin dir simply by replacing the library).
</p>
        <p>
Dpkg keeps a variety of files in its status area. These are discussed later
on in this document, but a quick summary of the files is here:-
</p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
          <ul class="itemizedlist">
            <li class="listitem">
              <p>
available - this file contains a concatenation of control information from all
the packages which dpkg knows about. This is updated using the dpkg commands
"--update-avail &lt;file&gt;", "--merge-avail &lt;file&gt;", and
"--clear-avail".
</p>
            </li>
            <li class="listitem">
              <p>
status - this file contains information on the following things for every
package:-
</p>
              <div class="itemizedlist">
                <ul class="itemizedlist">
                  <li class="listitem">
                    <p>
Whether it is installed, not installed, unpacked, removed, failed
configuration, or half-installed (deconfigured in favour of another package).
</p>
                  </li>
                  <li class="listitem">
                    <p>
Whether it is selected as install, hold, remove, or purge.
</p>
                  </li>
                  <li class="listitem">
                    <p>

</p>
                  </li>
                  <li class="listitem">
                    <p>
It usually also contains the section and priority (so that dselect may classify
packages not in available)
</p>

                  <li class="listitem">
                    <p>

              </div>
              <p>
The exact format for the "Status:" field is:
</p>
              <pre class="screen">
      Status: Want Flag Status
</pre>
              <p>

The dpkg utility itself is required for quite a number of packages, even if
they have been installed with a tool totally separate from dpkg. The reason
for this is that some packages, in their pre-installation scripts, check that
your version of dpkg supports certain features. This was broken from the
start, and it should have actually been a control file header "Dpkg-requires",
or similar. What happens is that the configuration scripts will abort or
continue according to the exit code of a call to dpkg, which will stop them
from being wrongly configured.

These special command-line options, which simply return as true or false are
all prefixed with "--assert-". Here is a list of them (without the prefix):-
</p>
          <div class="itemizedlist">
            <ul class="itemizedlist">
              <li class="listitem">
                <p>
support-predepends - Returns success or failure according to whether a version
of dpkg which supports predepends properly (1.1.0 or above) is installed,
according to the database.
</p>
              </li>
              <li class="listitem">
                <p>
working-epoch - Return success or failure according to whether a version of
dpkg which supports epochs in version properly (1.4.0.7 or above) is installed,
according to the database.
</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <p>
Both these options check the status database to see what version of the
"dpkg" package is installed, and check it against a known working version.
</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <div class="titlepage">
            <div>
              <div>
                <h3 class="title"><a id="s1.4.4"/>1.4.4. --predep-package</h3>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
This strange option is described as follows in the source code:
</p>
          <pre class="screen">
/* Print a single package which:
 *  (a) is the target of one or more relevant predependencies.
 *  (b) has itself no unsatisfied pre-dependencies.
 * If such a package is present output is the Packages file entry,
 *  which can be massaged as appropriate.
 * Exit status:
 *  0 = a package printed, OK
 *  1 = no suitable package available
 *  2 = error
 */
</pre>
          <p>
On further inspection of the source code, it appears that what is does is
this:-
</p>
          <div class="itemizedlist">
            <ul class="itemizedlist">
              <li class="listitem">
                <p>
Looks at the packages in the database which are selected as "install",
and are installed.
</p>
              </li>
              <li class="listitem">
                <p>
It then looks at the Pre-Depends information for each of these packages
from the available file. When it find a package for which any of the
pre-dependencies are not satisfied, it breaks from the loop through the
packages.
</p>
              </li>
              <li class="listitem">
                <p>
It then looks through the unsatisfied pre-dependencies, and looks for
packages which would satisfy this pre-dependency, stopping on the first
it finds. If it finds none, it bombs out with an error.
</p>
              </li>
              <li class="listitem">
                <p>
It then continues this for every dependency of the initial package.
</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <p>
Eventually, it writes out the record of all the packages to satisfy the
pre-dependencies. This is used by the disk method to make sure that its
dependency ordering is correct. What happens is that all pre-depending
packages are first installed, then it runs dpkg -iGROEB on the directory,
which installs in the order package files are found. Since pre-dependencies
mean that a package may not even be unpacked unless they are satisfied, it
is necessary to do this (usually, since all the package files are unpacked
in one phase, the configured in another, this is not needed).
